ProjectEuler
============

This repository is for those wishing to work on their own set of project Euler problems.  

The idea is to provide a way for those new to Java to see simple snippets of code, especially as a way to introduce those new to the language.  It is not intended to provide quick & easy solutions to the problems presented by project euler.
